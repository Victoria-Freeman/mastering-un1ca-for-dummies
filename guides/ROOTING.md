# Rooting

In order to master UN1CA we need to root our device. It's a crucial thing to fully master UN1CA.

There are some root solution that you can use:

- Magisk
- KernelSU
- KernelSU Next

### Magisk

In order to root your device with Magisk you need to download the Magisk apk from [here](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases).

Once you have the apk reboot in recovery and flash the apk as if it would be a normal zip file.

Then reboot into the system and install the apk itself. Open the app and go through the setup.

### KernelSU

For KSU (KernelSU) you need to have a compatible kernel zip file for your device. You should be able to find it on the internet.

Since we use UN1CA-ext4 and not UN1CA you shouldn't care in whatever the kernel supports erofs or not.

To use KSU you need to boot into recovery and flash the kernel zip file. Then reboot into the system and install the [apk](https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU/releases) itself. Open the app and you should be good to go.

Here is one of kernels that you can use (RIO kernel):

- [A73](https://t.me/yagzawg/434)
- [M52](https://t.me/yagzawg/436)

Special thanks to [Fraxer](https://t.me/Frax3r) for making this kernel!

### KernelSU Next

KSUN (KernelSU Next) is a fork of KernelSU so you need another kernel in order to use it

You can find the manager app [here](https://github.com/KernelSU-Next/KernelSU-Next/releases).
