# Getting the Basics

Welcome! Now that you've successfully installed UN1CA (congrats! 🎉), let's cover the basics to help you get started.

## Why This Guide Matters

UN1CA is built on OneUI, which comes with many pre-installed apps and services. To get the most out of your ROM while maintaining privacy and performance, you need to understand how to control what runs on your device.

## Before Connecting to Wi-Fi

**Wait!** Before you connect to Wi-Fi, read this section carefully.

### Why You Shouldn't Connect Right Away

OneUI comes with many apps that automatically connect to the internet once Wi-Fi is enabled. Many of these apps:
- Run in the background without your knowledge
- Consume data and battery
- May send telemetry and usage data

### The Key to Mastering UN1CA: Control

The secret to mastering UN1CA is simple: **stay in control**. This means:
- Deciding which apps can access the internet
- Blocking unnecessary background services

### Root Access Required

To have full control over Wi-Fi and network access, **you'll need root permissions**. Root access is essential for:
- Controlling which apps can use Wi-Fi
- Blocking background network activity

> If you haven't rooted your device yet, check out the [Rooting Guide](ROOTING.md) first.

## Next Steps

Once you have root access, you'll be ready to:
1. Connect to Wi-Fi safely
2. Manage app running in the background
3. Control network access per app
